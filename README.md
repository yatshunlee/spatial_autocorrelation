# spatial_autocorrelation
Performing Moran's I to conduct correlation analysis on topological relationship.

In statistics, Moran's I is a measure of spatial autocorrelation developed by Patrick Alfred Pierce Moran. Spatial autocorrelation is characterized by a correlation in a signal among nearby locations in space. Spatial autocorrelation is more complex than one-dimensional autocorrelation because spatial correlation is multi-dimensional (i.e. 2 or 3 dimensions of space) and multi-directional.[1]

From the example.ipynb, you can see how the values of blocks are correlated with the values of neighbours spatially
